1. Introduction

This is a C code set of CrossMatch. The files include two CrossMatch 
programs: original and sampling approaches.
The details of CrossMatch are described in the following paper:

 Machiko Toyoda, Yasushi Sakurai, and Yoshiharu Ishikawa:
 ``Pattern Discovery in Data Streams under the Time Warping Distance,''
 VLDB Journal


2. Quick demo

  -- CrossMatch original approach 
      Folder: CrossMatch

    (*) Compile source files
	$ make all

    (i) Detect similar subsequence pairs with synthetic datasets
	Result file name: result.txt

	$ sh demo.sh

    (ii) Plot optimal warping paths of similar subsequence pairs
	   (Require perl and gnuplot for the demo)
	 Result file name: result.txt and path.txt
	 Plot file name: fig.eps

	$ sh demo-path.sh


  -- CrossMatch sampling approach (fixed sampling period only)
      Folder: Sampling

    (*) Compile source files
	$ make all

    (i) Detect similar subsequence pairs with synthetic datasets
	Result file name: result-sampling.txt

	$ sh demo-sampling.sh

    (ii) Plot optimal warping paths of similar subsequence pairs
	  (Require perl and gnuplot for the demo)
	Result file name: result-sampling.txt and path-sampling.txt
	Plot file name: fig-sampling.eps

	$ sh demo-sampling-path.sh


3. Details of each file

 ** result.txt and result-sampling.txt
    The first column represents subsequences of X, i.e., X[is:ie].
    'is' is a starting position and 'ie' is a ending position.
    Similarily, the second column represents subsequences of Y, 
    i.e., Y[js:je]. The third column represents DTW distances and 
    the forth column represents score values. For example, 

     X[    9: 7644]  Y[ 1805: 9995]   DTWdist: 32.8  score: 362.88

    the subsequence of X starting from time-tick 9 and ending at 7644 
    and the subsequence of Y starting from time-tick 1805 and ending
    at 9995 are one of optimal subsequence pairs. Their DTW distance 
    is 32.8 and their score is 362.88. 

 ** CrossMatch/crossmatch.c, Sampling/crossmatch-sampling.c
    Main programs of CrossMatch. In each files, initial settings are 
    pattern discovery. If you want to measure the computation time, 
    please set EXPERIMENT value (#define parameter) at 0.

 ** CrossMatch/path.c Sampling/path.c
    A program for calculating optimal warping paths. To run path.c, 
    you need to create matrix log files of every starting position 
    by using createfile.pl or createfile-sampling.pl. 

 ** CrossMatch/naive.c
    A program for naive solution. you can compile it by the command
    'make naive'.
